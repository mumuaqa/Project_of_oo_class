In our latest game update, we have introduced a new turtle monster. Defeating this creature will reward players with an additional life. Additionally, when players have more than one life, they will activate a brief period of invincibility upon receiving an attack. This feature is designed to provide players with a chance to recover and strategize while adding an extra layer of challenge to the game.
